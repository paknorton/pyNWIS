04237496	Records from November 1898 to December 1908 determined on basis of head on dam, flow through 10 mills nearby, lockages at Oswego Canal lock, estimated leakage of dam, wheel gates, flumes, and penstocks; not adjusted for inflow from Lake Erie through Erie (Barge) Canal. Records from November 1949 to September 1996, computed by using fall as determined by auxiliary water-stage recorder. Records from October 1996 to September 2014, computed by using standard stage-discharge methods. Low and medium flows from November 1949 to September 2014, affected by large diurnal fluctuations caused by powerplants upstream from station at site then in use. Published record, November 1949 to September 2014, represents the total flow at Baldwinsville and includes flow in Erie (Barge) Canal. Low and medium flows at present site can be affected by operation of powerplants and Lock 24 on Erie (Barge) Canal 1.6 mi downstream from gage. Seneca River basin receives water from Erie (Barge) Canal through Lock 32 near Pittsford. A large amount of natural storage and some artificial regulation is afforded by many large lakes and the Erie (Barge) Canal system in the river basin. From 1931-98, a large part of flow from 45.5 mi² of Mud Creek drainage area (Susquehanna River basin) had been diverted into Keuka Lake (Oswego River basin) for power generation. Water Years 2014-16: Records good except those for estimated daily discharges, which are poor.
04239000	High flows regulated by Onondaga Reservoir. Water years 2014-15: Records good except those for estimated daily discharges, which are fair. Water years 2016-17: Records good except those for estimated daily discharges, which are poor.
04243500	Occasional regulation by small mills upstream from station. Water Years 2014-16: Records good except those for estimated daily discharges, which are fair.
04249000	Prior to 1933 and subsequent to 1972, flow in Oswego (Barge) Canal not included. A large amount of natural storage and some artificial regulation is afforded by the many large lakes and the Erie (Barge) and Oswego (Barge) Canal systems in the river basin. Large diurnal fluctuations at low and medium flow caused by powerplants upstream from station. Oswego River basin receives water from Erie (Barge) Canal through Lock 32 near Pittsford. Water may be diverted into or received from Mohawk River basin through summit level of Erie (Barge) Canal between New London and Utica. Nearly all of the flow from 14 mi² of the Tioughnioga River basin may be diverted into De Ruyter Reservoir in Oswego River basin. From 1931-98, a large part of flow from 45.5 mi² of Mud Creek drainage area (Susquehanna River basin) had been diverted into Keuka Lake (Oswego River basin) for power generation. Water Years 2014-16: Records good except those for estimated daily discharges, which are fair.
04252500	Occasional regulation by several headwater reservoirs. Forestport feeder diverts water from State Pond at Forestport 9 mi upstream. That portion of diverted water which does not pass Black River Canal (flowing south), returns to Black River downstream from station through Mill Creek sluiceway. Slight diurnal fluctuation at medium and low flow caused by powerplant upstream from station. Water Years 2014-16: Records fair except those for estimated daily discharges, which are poor.
04256000	Water Years 2014-17: Records good except those for estimated daily discharges, which are poor.
04258000	Flow regulated by Stillwater Reservoir (station 04256500). Between Stillwater Dam and this station, flow is further regulated by several powerplant ponds. Diurnal fluctuation at low and medium flow. Water Years 2014-16: Records good except those for estimated daily discharges, which are poor.
04260500	Flow regulated by Stillwater Reservoir (station 04256500), Fulton Chain of Lakes, and other reservoirs. Extensive diurnal fluctuation at low and medium flow caused by mills and powerplants in and above Watertown. During canal season, water is diverted out of basin through Forestport feeder and Black River Canal (flowing south). Water Years 2014-15: Records good except those for estimated daily discharges, which are poor. Water Year 2016: Records good.
04262500	Since June 1985, extensive diurnal fluctuation and slight regulation caused by powerplant upstream from station. Water Years 2014-17: Records good except those for estimated daily discharges, which are poor.
04263000	Entire flow regulated by Cranberry Lake (station 04260990); slight diurnal fluctuation at low flow and medium flow caused by powerplants. During high stages on Grass River, part of flow of that stream may pass through Upper Lake, Indian Creek, and Lower Lake and enter Oswegatchie River at Rensselaer Falls, 4.5 mi upstream from station. In October 1973, a dike was installed on Indian Creek to prevent overflow of Grass River during high flows. Water Years 2014-15: Records good except those for estimated daily discharges, which are poor. Water Year 2016: Records good.
04264331	Since July 1958, flow regulated by international agreement administered by International St. Lawrence River Board of Control under the International Joint Commission. Records do not include water diverted from Lake Michigan by Illinois and Michigan Canal during period of its operation prior to 1910 and by Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, which began operation in 1900. Records include water diverted into Lake Superior from Hudson Bay drainage by the Long Lake Project, which began operation in July 1939, and by the Ogoki project, which began operation in July 1943.
